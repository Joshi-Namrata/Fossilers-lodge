# Vancouver Datajam 2023 Project by team Fossilers-lodge
********************************
## Project title: Energy Technology Budgets, Subsidies & Investments Analysis
********************************


## Problem statement(s) : 
Our aim with this project is to work towards following: 

**Comprehensive Data Compilation**: Compile and organize data on RD&D budgets, energy investments, and subsidies across countries and energy sectors into a unified and accessible database.

**Investment Impact Assessment**: Analyze the impact of energy investments, including their relationship with RD&D budgets and the influence of subsidies, on the adoption of clean energy technologies and emissions reduction.

**Cross-Country Benchmarking**: Benchmark the performance of countries in terms of investments, RD&D, and subsidies, facilitating peer learning and best practices exchange.

**Sector-Specific Insights**: Provide sector-specific insights into RD&D budgets, investments, and subsidies, enabling targeted strategies for sectors such as renewables, fossil fuels, and energy efficiency.

**Subsidy Efficiency Evaluation**: Assess the efficiency of subsidies provided to different energy sectors in achieving sustainability and emissions reduction goals, offering recommendations for optimization.
