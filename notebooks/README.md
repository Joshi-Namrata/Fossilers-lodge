## Notebooks

This is the space for team's Noteable notebook, every user has their own personal notebook and if there needs to be any data sharing team can extract data in csv. 
Since the team is using Noteable, we dint have to run any seperate scripts to pull data. 

Following are the areas of focus for the team: 

*Alejandro*: Cross-Country Benchmarking

*Namrata*: Investment Impact Assessment

*Iruoma*: Investment Impact Assessment

*Mrinal*:  Sector-Specific Insights

*Brian*:  Subsidy Efficiency Evaluation




**NOTE**: In order for anyone to run the same analysis they need to make sure they have access to the data stores to run cells of notebook which access integrated clickhouse datastore.
